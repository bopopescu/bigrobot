Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --account-pool=FILE   Reads the user/password combination from the given
                        file instead of prompting on the command line. The
                        file may also contain more than one user/password
                        combination, in which case the accounts are used round
                        robin.
  -c NUM, --connections=NUM
                        Maximum number of concurrent connections. NUM is a
                        number between 1 and 20, default is 1.
  --csv-hosts=FILE      Loads a list of hostnames and definitions from the
                        given file. The first line of the file must have the
                        column headers in the following syntax: "hostname
                        [variable] [variable] ...", where the fields are
                        separated by tabs, "hostname" is the keyword
                        "hostname" and "variable" is a unique name under which
                        the column is accessed in the script. The following
                        lines contain the hostname in the first column, and
                        the values of the variables in the following columns.
  -d PAIR, --define=PAIR
                        Defines a variable that is passed to the script. PAIR
                        has the following syntax: STRING=STRING.
  --default-domain=STRING
                        The IP domain name that is used if a given hostname
                        has no domain appended.
  --delete-logs         Delete logs of successful operations when done.
  -e EXSCRIPT, --execute=EXSCRIPT
                        Interprets the given string as the script.
  --hosts=FILE          Loads a list of hostnames from the given file (one
                        host per line).
  -i, --non-interactive
                        Do not ask for a username or password.
  -l DIR, --logdir=DIR  Logs any communication into the directory with the
                        given name. Each filename consists of the hostname
                        with "_log" appended. Errors are written to a separate
                        file, where the filename consists of the hostname with
                        ".log.error" appended.
  --no-echo             Turns off the echo, such that the network activity is
                        no longer written to stdout. This is already the
                        default behavior if the -c option was given with a
                        number greater than 1.
  -n, --no-authentication
                        When given, the authentication procedure is skipped.
                        Implies -i.
  --no-auto-logout      Do not attempt to execute the exit or quit command at
                        the end of a script.
  --no-prompt           Do not wait for a prompt anywhere. Note that this will
                        also cause Exscript to disable commands that require a
                        prompt, such as "extract".
  --no-initial-prompt   Do not wait for a prompt after sending the password.
  --no-strip            Do not strip the first line of each response.
  --overwrite-logs      Instructs Exscript to overwrite existing logfiles. The
                        default is to append the output if a log already
                        exists.
  -p STRING, --protocol=STRING
                        Specify which protocol to use to connect to the remote
                        host. Allowed values for STRING include: dummy,
                        pseudo, ssh, ssh1, ssh2, telnet. The default protocol
                        is telnet.
  --retry=NUM           Defines the number of retries per host on failure.
                        Default is 0.
  --retry-login=NUM     Defines the number of retries per host on login
                        failure. Default is 0.
  --sleep=TIME          Waits for the specified time before running the
                        script. TIME is a timespec as specified by the 'sleep'
                        Unix command.
  --ssh-auto-verify     Automatically confirms the 'Host key changed' SSH
                        error  message with 'yes'. Highly insecure and not
                        recommended.
  --ssh-key=FILE        Specify a key file that is passed to the SSH client.
                        This is equivalent to using the "-i" parameter of the
                        openssh command line client.
  -v NUM, --verbose=NUM
                        Print out debug information about the network
                        activity. NUM is a number between 0 (min) and 5 (max).
                        Default is 1.
  -V NUM, --parser-verbose=NUM
                        Print out debug information about the Exscript
                        template parser. NUM is a number between 0 (min) and 5
                        (max). Default is 0.
