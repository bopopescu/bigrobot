# document: https://bigswitch.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BSC/T6+Upgrade section: 6.4
# The purpose of this test suite is to verify ztn function with upgrade.
# Test topology:  2 controllers,  2 spines and 6 leaves.
# Configuration:    
# Note: prerequisites:  ONIE installed switch 
#       no support: ONIE install and  ONIE (u-boot) upgrade. 
#                   loader upgrade  
#       support:  loader install, swi upgrade
#       upgrade commit/abort not implemented
# In this Test Suite the following terms will be used:
# - stand-by switch - switch configured on the controller (with MAC address) with no fabric-role specified
# - provisioned switch - switch configured on the controller (with MAC address) with fabric role, forwarding traffic
# - suspended switch - switch connected to fabric but not configured on the controller,
#   or running wrong version of Swith Light, or with incorrect running-config
#
# Typical upgrade check:  configuration  - remain
#                         log files     -  not wiped out
#                         traffic       -  loss based on the test case 
#                         fabric config -  remain
#                         forwarding table - converged if switch need to reload

#####################  review ##################
#Date:  8/26/2014
#Attendee:   Jaiprakash, Bala, Srini, Mike, Cliff
#Note:
#   1.  Remove revert keyword from upgrade, since revert is default behavior -    Mingtao to file the JIRA
#   2.  Define phase II switch upgrade failure behavior  -  JP to talk to customer and file JIRA
#   3.  Remove test case:  HAEVENT: T13.5 HA event - master vm event.
#   4.  Remove non ZTN support test cases: 
#   5.  MIS: T101 verify 3 node controller upgrade:   double check and see cluster can form with 3 nodes
#   6.  MIS: T109 upgrade when controller does not have enough space <<<<<<  nothing to do upgrade
#   7.  Define single node upgrade flow -     Mike/Srini  to discuss
