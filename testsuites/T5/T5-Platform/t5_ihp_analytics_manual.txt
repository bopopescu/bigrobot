#Resource consumption
#cgroup limits
#CPU limits tested by enforcing load on one of controllers (A) while the other is not stressed (B) "dd if=/dev/urandom | bzip2 -9 >> /dev/null"
#I compared outputs of TOP command, for elasticsearch, while polling for entries in the database
#While collecting data, ES on not stressed controller (B) was using plenty of CPU resources to gather data, more than when ES is idle
#While collecting data, loaded controller (A) was using close to the same CPU percentage as when ES is idle
#That proved limitation of CPU limit in cgroups is working

#Memory use was verified by checking contents of /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/es/memory.max_usage_in_bytes
#It was confirmed that max usage does exceed the enforced limit

#With limited resources performance downgrade was not that obvious. Requests against ES were taking longer
#when CPU was busy with other processes. Overall, when CPU is idle and ES does not have to compete with other
#processes for resources, it uses as much CPU as it requires (standard cgroup behavior).
