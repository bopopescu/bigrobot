Documentation       T5 IH+ GUI Test Plan

...		The purpose of this test plan is to point out and test most important actions that users can perform with GUI. For the time being these tests will be executed manually
...
...		Each configuration change in GUI can be done in many ways (different ordering of intermediate configuration steps). The main focus will be to make sure that each configuration action (e.g. configuring a segment under given tenant) can be done in the most straightforward way. Not all permutations will be tested.
...
...		Configuration changes will be tested on a small-scale setup - HA cluster with 5 switches. For tests that verify presentation of information in tables and on graphs, scale testbed will be used.
...
...		During testing, Virtual IP will be used most of the time, logged in as user admin. Targeted test cases might be executed using IP addresses of Active, Standby controllers, logging in with other user accounts.
