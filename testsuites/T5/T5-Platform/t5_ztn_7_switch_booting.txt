Documentation       Testing ZTN
...              The purpose of this test suite is to check managing switches with ZTN. Small testbed will be used.
...
...              *Test topology*: pair of controllers, one spine switch, two leaf switches (Accton).
...
...              For tests which check correct installation of flows on the switches, simple forwarding configuration
...              and small traffic rate will be used.
...              Larger testbeds will be tested inherently in other testsuites.
...
...              In this Test Suite the following terms will be used:
...
...              * stand-by switch - switch configured on the controller (with MAC address) with no fabric-role specified
...
...              * provisioned switch - switch configured on the controller (with MAC address) with fabric role, forwarding traffic
...
...              * suspended switch - switch connected to fabric but not configured on the controller,
...                or running wrong version of Swith Light, or with incorrect running-config
...
...              * ztn-discovery mode - switch in the phase of booting/searching for ZTN servers with relevant manifest file
...
...              * ZTN configuration, which includes:
...
...                - configuration mirrored from controller's configuration to switches (NTP, Logging, SNMP)
...
...                - controllers' IP addresses
...
...                  - per-switch hostname (as switch name on the controller)
...
...                  - per-switch interface configuration (as assigned by DHCP server when switch booted)
...
...              * ZTN configuration change:
...
...                - any controller Cli change that affects the switch startup-config
...
...              * Switch mode change:
...
...                - any controller Cli change that affects the switch provisioning (fabric role, MAC)

*** Test Cases ***
#7.26-28: behavior is undefined, it is timing dependent; in all cases the switch should be visible from the controller Cli and should be rebootable to stabilize the fabric
#7.26. Verify following behaviors when switch's MAC gets deleted during switch boot up
T7.26.1 - while Installer download - no SWI download
	Cli Run  master  enable; config
	Cli Run  master  system uninstall switch ${s1_alias} reboot factory-default
	Sleep  20
	Telnet Verify Onie Discovery Succeeded  s1
	Cli Run  master  switch ${s1_alias}; no mac ${s1_mac}
	Sleep  100
	Telnet Verify ZTN Discovery Failed  s1
	Telnet Verify ZTN Discovery Failed  s1
	Verify Switch Connection State  False  ${s1_alias}
	Verify Switch Fabric Connection State  not_connected  ${s1_alias}

T7.26.2.1 - while SWI download - startup-config not cached - switch does not boot
    Telnet Delete ZTN Cache  all  s2
    Cli Reboot Switch  master  ${s2_mac}
    Telnet Wait For Switch To Find Manifest  s2
    Cli Run  master  switch ${s2_alias}; no mac ${s2_mac}
    Sleep  60
    Telnet Verify ZTN Discovery Failed  s2
    Telnet Verify ZTN Discovery Failed  s2
    Verify Switch Connection State  False  ${s2_alias}
    Verify Switch Fabric Connection State  not_connected  ${s2_alias}

T7.26.2.2 - while SWI download - startup-config cached - switch undefined
    Telnet Delete ZTN Cache  swi  s3
    Cli Reboot Switch  master  ${s3_mac}
    Sleep  30
    Telnet Wait For Switch To Find Manifest  s3
    Cli Run  master  switch ${s3_alias}; no mac ${s3_mac}

    Verify Switch Connection State  False  ${s3_alias}
    Cli Run and Verify Output  master
    ...  show switch
    ...  ${s3_ip} suspended (No fabric role configured)

T7.26.3 - while image startup - switch rebooted (starts up, gets removed)
    Cli Reboot Switch  master  ${s4_mac}
    Sleep  30
    Telnet Wait For Switch To Start Booting  s4
    Cli Run  master  switch ${s4_alias}; no mac ${s4_mac}
    Sleep  60
    Verify Switch Connection State  False  ${s4_alias}
    Cli Run and Verify Output  master
    ...  show switch
    ...  ${s4_ip} suspended (No fabric role configured)
