# The purpose of this test suite is to check managing switches with ZTN. Small testbed will be used.
# Test topology: pair of controllers, one spine switch, two leaf switches (Accton).
# For tests which check correct installation of flows on the switches, simple forwarding configuration
# and small traffic rate will be used.
# Larger testbeds will be tested inherently in other testsuites.

# In this Test Suite the following terms will be used:
# - stand-by switch - switch configured on the controller (with MAC address) with no fabric-role specified
# - provisioned switch - switch configured on the controller (with MAC address) with fabric role, forwarding traffic
# - suspended switch - switch connected to fabric but not configured on the controller,
#   or running wrong version of Swith Light, or with incorrect running-config
# - ztn-discovery mode - switch in the phase of booting/searching for ZTN servers with relevant manifest file
# - ZTN configuration, which includes:
#   * configuration mirrored from controller's configuration to switches (NTP, Logging, SNMP)
#   * controllers' IP addresses
#   * per-switch hostname (as switch name on the controller)
#   * per-switch interface configuration (as assigned by DHCP server when switch booted)
# - ZTN configuration change:
#   * any controller Cli change that affects the switch startup-config
# - Switch mode change:
#   * any controller Cli change that affects the switch provisioning (fabric role, MAC)

T3.2. Verify that after ZTN configuration change (CLI, GUI, REST), admin is notified to trigger reload of configuration on the switch, and that after reload configuration on switch gets updated
#we eventually expect to do this automatically, but this does not happen currently
T3.3. Change ZTN configuration, do not reload the switch, restore old config (check if reload command on UI is still requested), reload switch - verify that config on switch is correct
T3.4. Change ZTN configuration, do not reload the switch, change config again (check if reload command on UI is still requested), reload switch - verify that config on switch is correct
T3.5. Change ZTN configuration, reload half of switches, restore old config - verify that all switches need to be reloaded
T3.6. Change ZTN configuration, reload half of switches, change config again - verify that all switches need to be reloaded
# reload notification in GUI/Cli not (yet) supported
T3.7. Disconnect all switches from the fabric (ma1 down) then do significant changes in fabric configuration (startup-config template, switch roles) - error should be presented, reconnect the switch - incorrect running config should be noticed by the controller and admin should be notified to take action (reload config on switch)
T3.8. Delete all switches from the controller, reboot all switches (they should keep looking for ZTN server). Copy RC from external source (config://, scp://, file) to running config, watch the fabric come up.

### Questions to ask
# Separate ZTN log
# Configuring MAC on two clusters (first-come first-serve?)
# Split brain will behave as configuring MAC on two clusters?
# Will changing fabric roles be supported / validated against switch model
# Will it be required to "shutdown" switch before introducing fabric-related changes? Deleting, changing fabric roles, MAC?
# Will we see what SL images are in upgrade package?
# Will we see at which stage of provisioning is given switch? e.g. downloading SL image, booting, ... ?
# Limit on switches that can be handled by ZTN?
# Validation of MAC addresses in CLI before making any changes? Invalid, broadcast, special MAC?
