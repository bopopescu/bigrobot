## Test Tpology: https://docs.google.com/a/bigswitch.com/document/d/1xxI_9UhNAFUwAIZ_lDHNO-P0r4Xaomxfwv2UDsLuRJo/edit
## FS/DS doc: https://bigswitch.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BSC/QoS+Implementation+on+Switch
##Notes:
##All Hosts are assumed to be Ixia ports, Total 5 ixia ports needed. one is destination and 4 are source ports

##Traffic pattern
## 4 Source ports sending to one destination port
## traffic between tors in a dual-tor (peer-link?)
## traffic between spine and leaf



##Controller CLI options:
## QoS enabled by default
## Mapping/Weights are below
##For data plane: .1p
## priority 0, 1 -> queue 0 Weight 2
## priority 2, 3 -> queue 1 Weight 4
## priority 4, 5 -> queue 2 Weight 6
## priority 6, 7 -> queue 3 Weight 8
 
 #Control traffic Checck with DEV--->
 ##The control plane packets -> queue 8
# CPU port has 7 queues going to 3 RX channels
#chan 1 <- queue 0 with weight 50, Fabric LLDP/LACP
#chan 1 <- queue 1 with weight 20, Front Panel LLDP/LACP
#chan 2 <- queue 2 with weight 15, APR/DHCP
#chan 2 <- queue 3 with weight 15, L2SrcMiss/StationMove
#chan 3 <- queue 4 with weight 5, Debug/Stat
#chan 3 <- queue 5 with weight 5, L3ToCPU
#chan 3 <- queue 6 with weight 5, L3DstMiss
##Data plane weight 2, Control plane weight 20
 
 
 ## TESTPLAN divided into below sections
 #1.) CLI
 #2.) Funcitonality/HW verifications (Control, data and ratelimiters at HW chip, and at Controller)
 #3.) Interactions with other Network infra elements (HA, add other items)
 #4.) Few negitive cases (process restarts)
 #5.) Few Scale cases               
                           
#
#GLobal Verifications
## Any Exceptions in Conttoller, LLDP/LACP/protocol timeouts? Packins rate to/from controller
## ofad crfashes, if any

## Default QoS: all weights are equal share, however .1p mappings are honored as above
