#Documentation   T5 Scale - Iron Horse
#...             export BIGROBOT_SUITE=t5_6spine_16rack_test_suite.txt
#...             Section A: Build a Scale configuration file
#...             Section B: Configure master/slave controllers in one cluster
#				Section C: Copy Scale Configuration file to Controller master
#					Topology:
#						6 spines, 16 rack (dual leaf)
#						All leafs have 40G uplinks to spines
#						Ixia and big-tap be used for traffic testing
#					Scale Config: 
#						1022/1023 user Tenants? (+ 1 system tenant vrf-0 + 1 external vrf-1 ? = 1024)
#						4088/4092 user VNS (4 VNS/ tenant, 0x001 and 0xfff  is reserved, 0x000 is not allowed =  4091/4095. Each Ixia ports will have 4k vlan configured)	
#						4088/4092 IP subnets (one per VNS subject to above limits)
#						All VNS will be applied across all leaf nodes including service rack
#						48K L3 host  for intra-tenant routing
#						48K L2 host 
#						16K CIDR routes ? (tables might be used for inter-tenant routing)
#						3K policy rules per leaf switches
#						ARP 2k per sec per switch
#					Performance:
#						Controller PACKET-IN 100k per second
#						No DHCP relay configured. No overlapping subnet.
#						MAC learning rate 2000 per sec for controller, and 200 per switch?
#					Gneralnote:
#						All testcases will be run with L2/L3 and external traffic
#						Will monitor and take snapshot of memory/cpu utilization on both controllers/switches
#						Monitor java exceptions
#						Traffic convergence time periods
