# Verification Template
#
# This file contains a list of test cases which have been manually verified.
# You can find the latest version of this file at
# bigrobot/templates/verication.<build_name>_debug.yaml
#
# * This file must be saved as
#   bigrobot/data/verification/verification.<build_name>.<user>.yaml
#   E.g.,
#     bigrobot/data/verification/verification.bvs_master_beta2_debug.don.yaml
#
# * File format:
#   - name:                the name of the test case (must be exact match)
#   - product_suite:       the name of the test suite including path (must be
#                            an exact match)
#   - status:              the test case status from the verification,
#                            should be either PASS or FAIL
#   - build_name_verified: the name of the build which was used to verify

#   - name: Verify L3 traffic honor more specific routes with ecmp group
#     product_suite: T5/L3/T5_L3_physical_inter/t5_layer3_physical_inter
#     status: PASS
