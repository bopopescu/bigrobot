# * Examples:
#
#   - name: Verify L3 traffic honor more specific routes with ecmp group
#     product_suite: T5/L3/T5_L3_physical_inter/t5_layer3_physical_inter
#     status: PASS
#     build_name_verified: 'bvs master #2794'
#     jira: 
#     notes: I manually verified this and it works.
#
#   - name: Add and delete all ECMP members in ecmp group
#     product_suite: T5/L3/T5_L3_physical_inter/t5_layer3_physical_inter
#     status: FAIL
#     build_name_verified: 'bvs master #2806'
#     jira: BVS-1598
#     notes: This test case failed continuously in regression. It also fails in my testbed some of the time.
