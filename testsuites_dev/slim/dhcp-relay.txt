* Test Case
Verify Host is able to get DHCP address
	Get DHCPv4 address

Get DHCPv4 address
	REST add tenant										${tenant1}
	REST add 
	${ipaddr}=	bash get interface ipv4 				h2	eth1
	${result}=	bash release dhcpv4 address 			h2 	eth1		${ipaddr}
	Should Be True										${result}
	sleep												2
	${ipaddr}= 	bash renew dhcpv4 address				h2 				eth1
	Should Not Be Empty									${ipaddr}		
	${ipaddr}= 	bash renew dhcpv4 address				h4 				eth1
	Should Not Be Empty									${ipaddr}
