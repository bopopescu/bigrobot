...             Section A: Build a Scale configuration file
...             Section B: Configure master/slave controllers in one cluster
				Section C: Copy Scale Configuration file to Controller master
					Topology:
						6 spines, 16 rack (dual leaf)
						All leafs have 40G uplinks to spines
						Ixia and big-tap be used for traffic testing
					Scale Config: 
						1022/1023 user Tenants? (+ 1 system tenant vrf-0 + 1 external vrf-1 ? = 1024)
						4088/4092 user VNS (4 VNS/ tenant, 0x001 and 0xfff  is reserved, 0x000 is not allowed =  4091/4095. Each Ixia ports will have 4k vlan configured)	
						4088/4092 IP subnets (one per VNS subject to above limits)
						All VNS will be applied across all leaf nodes including service rack
						48K L3 host  for intra-tenant routing
						48K L2 host 
						16K CIDR routes ? (tables might be used for inter-tenant routing)
						3K policy rules per leaf switches
						ARP 2k per sec per switch
					Performance:
						Controller PACKET-IN 100k per second
						No DHCP relay configured. No overlapping subnet.
						MAC learning rate 2000 per sec for controller, and 200 per switch?
					Gneralnote:
						All testcases will be run with L2/L3 and external traffic
						Will monitor and take snapshot of memory/cpu utilization on both controllers/switches
						Monitor java exceptions
						Traffic convergence time periods
