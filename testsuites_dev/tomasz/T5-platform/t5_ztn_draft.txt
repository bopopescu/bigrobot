# The purpose of this test suite is to check managing switches with ZTN. Small testbed will be used.
# Test topology: pair of controllers, one spine switch, two leaf switches (Accton).
# For tests which check correct installation of flows on the switches, simple forwarding configuration
# and small traffic rate will be used.
# Measure time to bring up out-of-the-box switch
# Measure time to reboot a switch with no significant config changes
# Measure time for new node to start serving ZTN after failover

# In this Test Suite the following terms will be used:
# - stand-by switch - switch configured on the controller (with MAC address) with no fabric-role specified
# - mission mode switch - switch configured on the controller (with MAC address) with fabric role, forwarding traffic
# - suspended switch - switch connected to fabric but not configured on the controller,
#   or running wrong version of Swith Light, or with incorrect running-config
# - ztn-discovery mode - switch in the phase of booting/searching for ZTN servers with relevant manifest file
# - ZTN configuration, which includes:
#   * configuration mirrored from controller's configuration to switches (NTP, Logging, SNMP)
#   * controllers' IP addresses
#   * per-switch hostname (as switch name on the controller)
#   * per-switch interface configuration (as assigned by DHCP server when switch booted)
