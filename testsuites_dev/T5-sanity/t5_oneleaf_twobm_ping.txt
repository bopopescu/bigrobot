* Test Case 

Configure Single Leaf Single Rack setup
   configure fabric switch

ping bm0 to bm1 single leaf single rack dynamic endpoints
   create a tenant  A 
   create a vns  A  A  
   create a portgroup  p1 
   add interface to portgroup  leaf0   leaf0-eth1  p1 
   create a portgroup  p2 
   add interface to portgroup  leaf0   leaf0-eth2  p2 
   add portgroup to vns  A  A  p1  -1 
   add portgroup to vns  A  A  p2  -1
   sleep  10 
   mininet ping  bm0  ${bm1_ip} 						 
	 
ping bm0 to bm1 single leaf single rack static endpoints
   delete portgroup from vns  A  A  p1  -1 
   delete portgroup from vns  A  A  p2  -1
   create a endpoint  A  A  e1 
   create a endpoint  A  A  e2 
   add portgroup to endpoint  A   A  e2  p2  -1
   add portgroup to endpoint  A   A  e1  p1  -1

Tear down the config 
   delete a tenant  A 
   delete interface from portgroup  leaf0  leaf0-eth1  p1
   delete interface from portgroup  leaf0  leaf0-eth2  p2
   delete a portgroup  p1
   delete a portgroup  p2
   remove fabric switch
