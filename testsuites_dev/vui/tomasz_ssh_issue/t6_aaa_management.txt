Documentation   T6 Remote AAA Test Suite Release:Jack Frost
...  The purpose of this testsuite is to verify proper communication with remote
...  AAA servers (RADIUS, TACACS) for the purposes of Authentication, Authorization
...  and Accounting functions.
...
...  Test suite can be executed against RADIUS or TACACS servers.
...  3 servers of each type are used.
...  For TACACS these are: ACS+ and two tac_plus servers.
...  For RADIUS these are: RADIUS server on ACS+ and two freeRadius servers.
...
...  Server timeout is generated randomly at each test suite run, in the range
...  1 - 8 seconds (not to exceed 25 second aggregated timeout with 3 servers).
...
...  In the test cases there are 0, 1, 2 or 3 AAA servers configured (order of
...  the configured servers is randomized at each test suite run).
...
...  Each of the configured servers can be reachable or not (dummy IP).
...  Reachable servers can have correct or incorrect secret configured.
...
...  All AAA functions are set to one of the 4 cases: local, remote, remote then
...  local, local then remote (other combinations will be covered in RBAC
...  test plan).
...
...  The test cases below are intended to cover all of reasonable permutations
...  of the factors listed above (number of servers, their reachability,
...  secret correctness, AAA configuration).
...
...  Verification in each test case is done by checking if users can log into
...  the controller - admin, local user (admin, read-only group) and remote user
...  (admin, read-only group).
...
...  Depending on the AAA configuration users are expected to log in successfully
...  or to not be able to log in.
...  SSH and Console access are checked.
...
...  At the end of each test case (in test case teardown) recovery access is
...  verified (through SSH and Console) to make sure that in each case
...  recovery user is still able to log into the controller.
