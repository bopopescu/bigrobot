# Description: The bigrobot master branch is updated frequently and isn't
# a good candidate for use by Jenkins pre-merge smoke test. We've created
# 3 branches to support the smoke test.
#    smoke_candidate - The candidate branch which will undergo some
#        regression testing before it's promoted to smoke_stable.
#    smoke_stable - The stable branch. This is what Jenkins uses.
#    smoke_stable_previous - The previous stable branch. We save this
#        before refreshing the stable branch. If for some reason,
#        smoke_stable is unstable, we can revert to the previous.
#
# Usage:
#    $ gitup_smoke_stable_previous
#    Merging changes from 'smoke_stable' to 'smoke_stable_previous'. Continue [y,n]?
#    ...
#
#    $ gitup_smoke_stable
#    Merging changes from 'smoke_candidate' to 'smoke_stable'. Continue [y,n]?
#    ...
#
#    $ gitup_smoke_candidate
#    Merging changes from 'master' to 'smoke_candidate'. Continue [y,n]?
#    ...
#
# As a workflow to deploy new smoke test updates, do:
#    $ gitup_smoke_stable_previous
#    $ gitup_smoke_stable
#    $ gitup_smoke_candidate
#

# Attention: The standard convention is to merge updates from branch into master
# (i.e., branch contains new changes). We're doing just the opposite. We assume
# master contains the latest changes which we will trickle down into the smoke
# branches. E.g.,
#
#   master ==> smoke_candidate ==> smoke_stable ==> smoke_stable_previous
#
git checkout $target
git merge $source
git push origin $target
