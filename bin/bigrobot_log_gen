# Call Robot Framework's rebot to generate the consolidated log.
# rebot unfortunately returns with a non-zero exit code which causes
# Jenkins build to fail. So here we wrap it with a successful exit.
# This script assumes that we're in a log directory where all the
# Robot log files are found. E.g.,
#   /home/bsn/workspace/VuiTest/bigtest/testlogs/
# 

rebot --name T5 --output master_output.xml --splitlog `find . -name output.xml`
